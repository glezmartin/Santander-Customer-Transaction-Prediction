# Santander Customer Transaction Prediction

This repository contains my proposed solution for Kaggle's [Santander Customer Transaction Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction) competition.

## Introduction

This competition created by Santander Bank proposes the development of a model for the detection of clients with a tendency to carry out transactions. To carry out the construction of this model, a set of data is available with a series of parameters (unknown) for each customer.
